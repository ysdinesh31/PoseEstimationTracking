# Human Pose Estimation and Tracking
**This research/code is cited from: (Zhe Cao, Gines Hidalgo, Tomas Simon, Shih-En Wei, Yaser Sheikh, OpenPose: Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields) & (Steven Chen, Richard R. Yang, Pose Trainer: Correcting Exercise Posture using Pose Estimation)**

## Introduction
In this project uses the concept of OpenPose to detect and track human body by generating keypoints on body joints and then connecting them forming a skeleton.This project was later extended to track a person performing the bicep curls workout and count the repitions only when the form of the exercise is proper. This projects uses the model developed by CMU <a href = 'https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose'>Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

## Python files
All the files are obtained from https://github.com/akhilvasvani/StackGAN-v2/tree/master/code except generate_images.py which is our built in code.
There are many files to list but here are the imported ones
  - **bicepcurl.py** main file that tracks and counts the bicep curl
  - **OpenPose_Notebook.py** performs basic pose estimation tasks

## How to train
Download training repo:
git clone https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train.git
1) Download the required LMDB file:
cd training; bash a_lmdbGetMpii.sh
2) Generate the Caffe ProtoTxt and shell file for training by running
python d_setLayers.py
3) Run bash train_pose.sh 0,1,2,3 (generated by d_setLayers.py) to start the training

## How to test
For Execution:
1) Download Code Repo:
git clone https://github.com/ysdinesh31/PoseEstimationTracking
2) To run open pose model: python OpenPose_Notebook.py
3) To run bicep curl counter: python bicep_curl.py
We can give image, video or live feed as input for openpose model.

## Dependencies for executing
1) Opencv can be installed using following command in terminal (as root user)
sudo apt-get install python3-opencv
2) NumPy can be installed using following commands in terminal
using conda: conda install numpy
using pip: pip install numpy
3) Caffe : sudo apt install caffe-cuda

## Normal Requirements
python 3.6+
Visual Studio Code or any other editor
OpenCV
Mediapipe 
NumPy
